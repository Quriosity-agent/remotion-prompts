## Prompt

Create a 1920x1080 dark-themed composition called 'AudioSpectrum' featuring an audio spectrum visualizer synced to funk.mp3 from the public folder, displaying 32 vertical frequency bars that bounce and pulse reactively to the bass, mids, and highs, with a vibrant gradient from magenta to cyan across the bars, each bar having a subtle glow effect and smooth rounded tops, the bars reflecting faintly on a glossy dark surface below, centered horizontally with gentle horizontal padding, the whole visualization fading in smoothly at the start, duration matching the full audio length at 30fps — allow changing the bar count, gradient colors, bar width, and glow intensity — use remotion-best-practices skill."

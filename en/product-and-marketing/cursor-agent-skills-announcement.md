## Prompt

Create a video project announcing Agent Skills, following Cursor brand rules. 1920×1080, 60fps. Typewriter text effect at about 1 character per frame, then hold for 3 seconds after typing on every title card. Line 1 types first, then line 2.

Card 1: “Agent Skills are now available” on line 1 and “in Cursor” on line 2
Card 2: “Skills let agents discover and run” and line 2 “specialized prompts and code.”
Then play the skills.mp4 recording full-screen, framed top-aligned for first 2 seconds, then zoom in (with easing) to the top-left by about 125%. Should be continuous zoom!
Final card: “This video was made entirely in Cursor" on line 1 and "with Remotion skills.” on line 2, then hold;
End with the existing end.mp4 animation full-screen.

Render and open the file inside Cursor’s browser tool to let me see it here!

# Notes:
# 1. Uses an existing screen recording @ericzakariasson made.
# 2. Uses our existing end card animation.
# 3. Had a Cursor rule with our brand guidelines and colors.

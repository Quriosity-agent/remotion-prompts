## Prompt

use remotion skills Create a 1080×1080 brand animation video, 8 seconds, black background.                                                              
                                                                                                                                    
  Core effect: Pixel block text-building animation. 4 colored cursors (purple, blue, pink, indigo) fly in from off-screen, scatter to 
  four corners, line up on the left side, then each cursor "builds" its assigned section of pixel text — blocks light up one by one as
   the cursor passes over them, like multiple people collaboratively editing code in real-time.                                       
                                                                                                                                    
  Text: Line 1 "SHILIU", Line 2 "VIBEKNOW" 

  Block style: 20px squares with 3D layered depth effect — dark purple base with concentric inset borders creating an
  embossed/recessed look.

  Timeline:
  - 0–0.4s: First cursor enters from top-left
  - 0.4–0.9s: 4 cursors scatter to different positions
  - 0.9–1.6s: Cursors line up on the left side
  - 1.6–5.0s: Cursors split up and build the pixel text simultaneously
  - 5.0–5.8s: Subtitle "coming soon" types in at the bottom
  - 5.5–8.0s: Cursors float away to the top, gently bobbing

  Color variant: Red edition (replace purple block palette with red tones)

## Prompt

Create a demo video of the Presscut app/product using remotion. Use react componenents to replicate VI elements and replicate the UI of the app as closely as possible. The app has a LOT of features/ functionality, so take guidance from the marketing home page/index for what to highlight, while keeping language simple and to-thepoint. Really grill me with questions to nail down exactly how the final video should look/feel and what content should be there. The ultimate goal of this is to replicate what me, the founder, would be showing/doing with a product demo with a customer.

## Prompt

Create a 1920x1080 dark-themed (#1A1A2E) composition called 'BarLineChart' with a combination chart showing monthly sales data â€” bars for revenue ($8K, $12K, $15K, $11K, $18K, $22K for Jan-Jun) that grow upward from the baseline, overlaid with a blue (#0B84F3) line tracking conversion rate (2.1%, 2.8%, 3.2%, 2.9%, 3.8%, 4.2%) that draws progressively with a glowing effect, bars animate sequentially with slight overlap while the line follows behind, include axis labels and a pulsing dot marker at the line tip, smooth spring-based timing over 120 frames at 30fps â€” use remotion-best-practices skill.

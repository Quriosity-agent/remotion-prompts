## Prompt

Create a premium 10-second motion graphics intro using Remotion and React.

Background: Clean white canvas with a subtle light-gray grid pattern.

Sequence of Events:

Scene 1 (The Setup): precise row of 8 colorful, filled geometric shapes (Pentagon, Triangle, Square, Circle, Hexagon, Diamond, Circle, Triangle) centered on screen with even spacing (90px). They should have a gentle, organic "breathing" idle animation.
Scene 2 (The Morph): Trigger a dynamic sequence where the shapes jump up, spin 180 degrees in mid-air, and smoothly morph (using flubber) into the bold block letters "R-E-M-O-T-I-O-N". Add a ghost-trail effect behind them during the jump for speed.
Scene 3 (The Arrival): Fly in the Remotion Logo from the left side to hover near the 'R'. Have it snap into place with a spring animation and immediately perform a full 360-degree rotation.
Scene 4 (The Wipe): Execute a slow, cinematic exit. The logo should slide smoothly across the entire screen from left to right. Implement a "Wipe Logic" where each letter of "REMOTION" vanishes (scales down/fades out) exactly in sync as the logo passes over it, creating an erasing effect.
Technical Requirements: Use remotion springs for all physics (damping: 14 for jumps, damping: 300 for the slow wipe). No strokes on shapes, only filled vibrant colors.

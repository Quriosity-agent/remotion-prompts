## Prompt

Use Remotion best practices skill. Create a 30-second video at 30fps. Start with a hook: white text on black background, 'Where do you even buy music anymore?' â€” fade it in, hold for 2 seconds, fade out.

Next section: show the Disc Depot logo from public/discdepot-logo.png. Use a warm orange gradient background. Add a subtle tagline below: 'Music, delivered.â€™.

In the next section, add a counter that counts up to 12,000 with a plus sign. Label it 'Happy customers'. Keep the same background style.

Create 5 CD album covers as abstract gradient cards. Different color combinations. Animate them sliding in one by one, arranged in a row.

Add artist names and song titles.

Letâ€™s add a final section:
End with a call to action: 'Find your sound.' and the URL 'discdepot.com'. Fade to black.

Letâ€™s improve the transition between series. For example: orange in the second section should interpolate from black to orange. Now itâ€™s just not too smooth. And improve that between sections.

Very nice! Can you make logo react to audio using `useAudioData` hook? https://www.remotion.dev/docs/use-windowed-audio-data.md

Can you make ALL scenes audio reactive? So that all elements dance to the music frequencies?

I want everything react to low frequencies only

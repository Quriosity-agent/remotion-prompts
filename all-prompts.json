At frame 40, introduce a cutout image of Jensen on the right side with an explosive spring entrance, continuous floating motion, and occasional digital glitch distortion (skew/hue-rotate), layered above rotating dashed tech rings and falling Matrix-style data streams. Simultaneously, slide in a Glassmorphism HUD panel from the left (dark semi-transparent green with a cut-corner clip-path) that displays \"CEO & Co-Founder\" and bio details using a Monospace font; ensure the text slides in from the far left (-600px) for a dynamic reveal.

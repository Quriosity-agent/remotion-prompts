## Prompt

use remotion best practices. import the following image into the project: '~/Desktop/Screenshot 2026-01-31 at 17.15.12.png' use tesseract CLI to do OCR and find the positions of the text. in remotion, make a new composition where you load the image and pad the article generously on a white full HD background. while the composition is running for 5 seconds, slowly, very subtly, zoom into it and slightly rotate the article in 3d from left to right. the overall rotation should be around 15deg for each axis. at the beginning, blur the whole composition and unblur it over 1 second. after the blur is done, evolve a highlighter from left to right using rough.js over the words "government shutdown" and "funding lapses". the image has a white background. make sure the the marker appears behind the text. when installing new dependencies, check for existing lockfiles and use the right package manager.

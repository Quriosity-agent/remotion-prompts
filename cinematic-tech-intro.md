## Prompt

Create a high-energy Remotion video component (1920x1080, 30fps) for a cinematic "CEO Introduction" featuring Jensen Huang, styled with a Cyberpunk/Tech-Corporate aesthetic. The scene should use a clean white background with a subtle radial noise texture and feature masssive, centered "JENSEN HUANG" text in the "Knewave" font (NVIDIA Green #76B900) that animates with a dramatic "pop-in" effect (scaling down from 3x to 1x). At frame 40, introduce a cutout image of Jensen on the right side with an explosive spring entrance, continuous floating motion, and occasional digital glitch distortion (skew/hue-rotate), layered above rotating dashed tech rings and falling Matrix-style data streams. Simultaneously, slide in a Glassmorphism HUD panel from the left (dark semi-transparent green with a cut-corner clip-path) that displays "CEO & Co-Founder" and bio details using a Monospace font; ensure the text slides in from the far left (-600px) for a dynamic reveal. Enhance the visual depth with a vertical green scanner line, animated corner brackets, and floating geometric particles (triangles/hexagons), using spring and interpolate for all smooth physics-based transitions.
